                  <span class="text2"> <p>Fellow traders and NFT collectors,
                  <br>
                  <br>
                    Welcome to Traders Anonymous. Welcome to utility generated liquidity.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                    The truth is that for many NFT holders, the main goal is to flip their NFTs for a profit. As traders by nature, we look at buying an NFT the same as opening a position. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The problem with many NFT collections, however, is that the liquidity required to close out these ‘trades’ depends entirely on the luck of the NFT project becoming popular. If this doesn't happen, the NFT almost instantly becomes useless.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    For this reason, most NFTs get minted, or even bought, only to sit in a wallet collecting dust.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Our goal with Traders Anonymous is to create liquidity via utility. We will use the fees generated from our NFT sales  to create a decentralised “Community Whale.'' 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Simply put, our community will use our fees to create treasuries which we will use to buy back our NFTs from the open market. By doing so, we will continuously be generating liquidity and royalties for our project and holders, and essentially “close the position for profit”
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Fees from our mint will be put into a staking treasury and secondary transaction fees will be put into a trading treasury. Our community decides the execution of these treasuries to ensure long-term liquidity for traders and collectors.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Staking and trading proposals will be voted on by holders to grow the respective treasuries.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Holders of 10 or more NFTs will become “Whale Holders.” Whale Holders will have the ability to submit proposals to be voted on by the community.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    All holders' votes will dictate proposal execution and incentives. Trades will be submitted as proposals and voted on by the NFT holders. Traders (any holder) will be able to vote, but not all will be able to make proposals.Traders can make trade proposals if sponsored by a whale.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    All holders have the ability to become whales via successful trade proposals sponsored by whales. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    NFTs that are bought back will be used to reward successful trade proposals with profits yielding a certain rate of return.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Legendary holders will become part of the team and will be entitled to secondary transaction royalties.
                    
                    
                    
                    The initial mint will be .15 ETH. Our mint will mimic a live trade and fluctuate throughout 3 distinct phases that our minters must determine for themselves. The Snipe, Ape, and FOMO phases will each last a limited amount of time. Be sure to mint yours right away.</span>
